# Generic Function Definitions for dbverse

This file contains all generic function definitions for the dbverse
ecosystem. All generics are defined here once to avoid duplicate
definition errors. Method implementations are defined in their
respective files.

## Details

Centralizing generic definitions helps avoid the "no method found for
function..." error that occurs when the same generic is defined in
multiple files.
