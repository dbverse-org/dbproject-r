# Introduction
The `dbProject` package provides a user-friendly approach to creating and managaing a local database connection. It relies on the `pins` and `connections` R packages.

`dbProject` objects are R6 object that contains a pinned connection object and other pinned objects in a user-specified directory known as a `pins_board`. 

A few reasons why we might want to use the `dbProject` approach are:

  1. Reconnecting to the database when necessary (e.g. after restarting R or disconnecting).
  2. Saving lazy database tables.
  3. Performing common database connection handling operations (e.g. connect, reconnect, etc).

## Creating and Connecting to a Local OLAP Database with DBI
The conventional approach for establishing a connection to a local OLAP database in R is through the `dbConnect` method as shown here.
```{r}
con_dbi <- DBI::dbConnect(drv = duckdb::duckdb(), dbdir = ":memory:")
```

### Creating a new `dbProject` object
To create a new `dbProject` object, we use the `dbProject$new()` method with these arguments:

- `path` refers to the location where the pins board will be stored for connection caching.
- `...` are additional arguments passed to `connections::connection_open()` (e.g., `dbdir` for database file path).

*Note* Because `dbProject` objects are R6 objects, we access the object's methods using the `$` operator.

**Best practice**: Assign database paths to variables before passing to `dbProject$new()`. This ensures proper path resolution for connection persistence.

```{r}
# Best practice: resolve paths first
project_dir <- "test_dbProject"
db_path <- file.path(project_dir, "test.db")

proj <- dbProject$new(path = project_dir, dbdir = db_path)

proj
```

The `dbProject$print()` method is run whenever the object is printed. It displays the `path` and `board` attributes of the object, as well as the contents of the board.

### Disconnecting from the database
When we are done with the database connection, we can disconnect using the `dbProject$disconnect()` method. This method closes the current connection, if any.
```{r}
proj$disconnect()

proj
```

### Reconnecting to the database
To reconnect to the database, we use the `dbProject$reconnect()` method. This method reads the connection object from the `pins_board` object and reconnects to the database.
```{r}
proj$reconnect()

proj
```

### Pinning Lazy Database Tables
```{r}
con <- proj$get_connection() # note: getConnection() returns a connConnection object from the {connections} R package.
mtcars <- dplyr::copy_to(con, mtcars, temporary = FALSE, overwrite = TRUE)
mtcars
```

We can add a database table to the `pins_board` object using the `proj$pin_write()` method. This method writes the database table to the board.
```{r}
proj$pin_write(x = mtcars, name = "mtcars")

proj
```

### Reading a pinned database table
After an R session restart or after disconnecting from the database, we can read a pinned database table using the `proj$pin_read()` method. This method reads the pinned object from the board.
```{r}
proj$disconnect()

proj

# read the pinned lazy table object
mtcars <- proj$pin_read(name = "mtcars")

mtcars
```
